This folder contains area-specific TODO documents for maintaining continuity throughout the project lifecycle.

## Quick Reference

| Area | File | Priority |

1. **Before starting work**: Check relevant TODO file for context
2. **During development**: Add new items as you discover them
3. **After completing work**: Update status of completed items
4. **Session handover**: Reference these files in HANDOVER.md
